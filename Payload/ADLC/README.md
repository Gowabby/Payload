This file contains code to complete ADLC task specified in the AUVSI rules:

7.3. AUTOMATIC DETECTION, LOCALIZATION, AND CLASSIFICATION (ADLC) TASK (SECONDARY)
Table 4:  ADLC Parameters
Parameter                                                   Threshold         Objective
Automatic Localization (each target, standard, and QRC)     n/a               Identify target position within 150 ft.
Automatic Classification (each standard target)             n/a               Identify at least three of five target characteristics.
Automatic Classification (each QRC target)                  n/a               Decode the message.
False Alarm Rate (FAR) on Classification                    n/a               Demonstrate <50% FAR.


7.3.1. Teams shall develop an algorithm which performs automated detection of 
potential targets and cues the imagery judge.  The algorithm shall localize the
detected targets and automatically determine the target characteristics.

7.3.2. Credit will be given for each target automatically detected & cued, up to six
targets.

7.3.3. ADLC may be performed by any combination of airborne or ground‐based
processing.

7.3.4. Teams shall make their ADLC process very clear to the imagery judge prior to
aircraft takeoff.
7.3.4.1. If a judge is unclear about or suspects manual assistance to the ADLC
process, the team shall not receive ADLC task points.

7.3.5. Demonstrating an ADLC target
7.3.5.1. ALL automatic detections shall be clearly shown to the imagery judge
without human interaction (e.g. a pop‐up window).   
7.3.5.2. The first six detections shown shall be considered a team’s entry for the ADLC task.  These detections shall be turned into the judges by
filling out a single dedicated target information sheet, given in Appendix E.
This target information sheet shall be marked clearly with “Automatic Detections” and handed in separate from other imagery
sheets. or provided electronically in accordance with Appendix D, and clearly marked in tab 11 as “Auto Detection

7.3.6. False Alarm Rate
7.3.6.1. If a listed target fails to meet the objective for classification, the target
will be considered a false detection.  The number of incorrect ADLC
targets reported will be divided by the total number of ADLC targets
reported to determine false alarm rate.
7.3.6.2. Each detection/target is counted once.  If the false alarm rate exceeds
the objective limit, no credit will be given for the ADLC task
