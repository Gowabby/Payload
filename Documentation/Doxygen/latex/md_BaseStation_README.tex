This directory contains all of the code for the base station, including the Base\-Station\-Comms A\-D\-L\-C and the Payload\-G\-U\-I.

{\bfseries Base\-Station\-Comms} --- Establishes and maintains a network connection between the Base Station and the Payload. Tracks changes from the Payload\-G\-U\-I and transmits packets to the payload. Also accepts incoming packets from the payload and alerts the Payload\-G\-U\-I.

{\bfseries Payload\-G\-U\-I} --- The main interface for controlling the payload. Gives the user an intuitive graphical interface with which to establish a network connection and control critical payload functionality such as starting camera capture and A\-D\-L\-C. Also has the capability to scan through the images transmitted back to the Base Station.

{\bfseries A\-D\-L\-C} --- All of the image processing code running on the base station.
