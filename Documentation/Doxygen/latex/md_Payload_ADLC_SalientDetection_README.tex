This folder contains the code for region of interest detection and cropping.

It is a salient object detection method that uses a sobel filter of the u$\ast$ and v$\ast$ channels of the Lu$\ast$v$\ast$ color space.

\section*{Action/result chart\-: }

image input $\vert$ $\vert$ cropped regions of interest output

This is just showing how the code will work for testing purposes.

\section*{Algorithm description }

-\/optimize the algorithm (gpu?)

\section*{Files in folder }

\hyperlink{salient__detection_8cpp}{salient\-\_\-detection.\-cpp} -\/ this is the main file that needs to be run

I\-M\-G\-\_\-0494/0526 -\/ test images that the code uses to crop

cropped\-Img -\/ the file where detected roi of interest are saved
