This folder contains python scripts that are meant to test parts of a shape detection algorithm I am working on.

The alogrithm assumes potential targets have already been cropped. The end functionalilty will scan all of these images and only return the ones that have ground targets in them. This will comply with all standards that are stated in the A\-U\-V\-S\-I rules for the A\-D\-L\-C task. These scripts are compiled using the python 2.\-7 on windows with opencv 2.\-4.\-10 (the current stable version)

\section*{Action/result chart\-: }

cropped images input $\vert$ \subsection*{$\vert$ }

$\vert$ $\vert$ $\vert$ $\vert$ \hyperlink{structTarget}{Target} detected no target detected $\vert$ $\vert$ $\vert$ $\vert$ images saved return to start

This is just showing how the code will work for testing purposes.

\section*{Algorithm description }

The algorithm will consist of three parts\-:

-\/\-Image preprocessing \begin{DoxyVerb}            -First we segment the image into 3 three different colors

            -the next step is to convert the image to the luv color space

            -Next we sum the u* and  v* channels together

            -Then we use a sobel filter to find changes in color

            -next we use canny edge detection

              -This will allow the detector to detect the geometry of the target. If features arent drawn from the canny image then
              the surf features will detect the intensity of the image. This is not the point of the algorithm. The algorithm is only 
              meant to detect shapes not color.
\end{DoxyVerb}


-\/surf feature detection \begin{DoxyVerb}            -just uses opencv's surf library

              -should be faster than sift
\end{DoxyVerb}


-\/machine learning portion \begin{DoxyVerb}            -still doing research on this portion going to try to impliment three types

              -FLANN matching: currently being developed

                link: http://bit.ly/1tH9a6P

              -knn

                link: http://bit.ly/1vzLlba

              -svm

                link: http://bit.ly/1HjINq4
\end{DoxyVerb}
