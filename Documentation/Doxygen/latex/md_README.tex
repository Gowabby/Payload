This folder contains all code for the U\-A\-V payload, the base station code for controling the payload, and testing data sets.

\section*{Payload functionalites\-: }

-\/\-A\-D\-L\-C\-: Will allow the U\-A\-S to automatically detect, characterize, and localize ground targets without any human intervention.

-\/\-I\-M\-A\-G\-E P\-A\-S\-S T\-H\-R\-O\-U\-G\-H\-: will allow for images to be passed directly from the camera to the ground station without any object detection algorithms being run on it. This will allow for completion of the emergent and off axis target identification.

-\/\-S\-R\-I\-C\-: will allow for the uav to connect to a remote intelligence center and retreive data that is on the server.

\section*{Folders\-: }
